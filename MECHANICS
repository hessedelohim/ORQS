***<ins>Advantage / Disvantage</ins>***

> Depend of the action the player want to do, respect from the situation, three cases can be:
> 
> - Disvantage: the character reacts to an unexpected situation, or the situation is notably unfavorable due the enviroment or to its conditions (characteristics, status, weaknesses, etc).
> - Normal: nothing out of the ordinary in the setting or proposed actions.
> - Advantage: due to some external or internal condition of the character, it have the natural opportunity to obtain better results (is the one who ambushes, knows an answer in advance, attacks against a weakness, etc).
> 
> All these kind of onsiderations can be proposed by the players as well as by the storyteller, although their application is on the discretion of the last one. These can be specified in an ±X to the TVD (ex.: +1 on advantage).

***<ins>Movement</ins>***

> Unlike other systems, and to keep the idea of simplicity, at the beginning it was not thought to consider the movements of the characters in a measurable way, especially during battle. But this could easily be added with simple rules, for example:
> 
> - Use a grid (I prefer the hexagonal one)
> - Limit the number of moves per character per turn during combat (ex. 5)
> - For even more complexity, use a fixed value plus additional ones depending on agility, skills, magic, etc.
> - Some negative bonus can also be taken into account, typical of a terrain condition, spell, etc.
