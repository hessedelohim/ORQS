## DESCRIPTION

ORQS is a lightweight rules system to get started with TTRPG games. For many players this system will be un-challenging due to its simplicity, if you are one of those who already know and play a more complex system, but want try a new approach or have light-fun with neewby friends, you may as well find a place with us. This is designed to be like a (very) basic framework on which everyone can build a personal core-book, for specific groups or games. Each "rule" is supposed to be considered in context, and most of the final decision are in hands of the Storyteller (GM), though they are also supposed to be flexible enough, to help the player not only understand, but also enjoy the experience ofÂ the dynamics of the TTRPGs. Remember... This is a game... We are here to have fun!

## **A very important consideration:**

This system was developed with a traditional-fantasy context In mind, but can be adapted to play in any other lore you prefer, from space wars, to western thrillers, or hunted mansions. Really, i mean, everything is meant to be easily changed, from modules to tables[^*], take the best of it, and put the best of yourself, only then will get the best results.

[^*]: You can also find the files of every table or sheet in open format.
