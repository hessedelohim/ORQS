ORQS is a lightweight rules system to get started with TTRPG games. For many players this system will be un-challenging due to its simplicity, if you are one of those who already know and play a more complex system, but want try a new approach or have light-fun with neewby friends, you may as well find a place with us. This is designed to be like a (very) basic framework on which everyone can build a personal core-book, for specific groups or games. Each "rule" is supposed to be considered in context, and most of the final decision are in hands of the Storyteller (GM), though they are also supposed to be flexible enough, to help the player not only understand, but also enjoy the experience ofÂ the dynamics of the TTRPGs. Remember... This is a game... We are here to have fun!
