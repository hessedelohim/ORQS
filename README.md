**ORQS IS A RULES-LITE 2d6 SYSTEM
TO GET STARTED WITH TTRPG GAMES**

<p align="justify">This is designed to be like a <i>(very)</i> <strong>basic framework on which everyone can build a personal core-book</strong>, for specific groups or games. Each "<i>rule</i>" is supposed to be considered in context, though they are also supposed to be flexible enough, to help the player not only understand, but also enjoy the experience of the dynamics of the TTRPGs.</p>

<p align="justify">For many players this system will be un-challenging due to its simplicity, if you are one of those who already know and play a more complex system, but want try a new approach or have light-fun with neewby friends, you may as well find a place with us.</p>

<p align="justify">The system was thought to be modular, that is, each part (or module) can be used separately, or combined with others, without the need to use all of them. You will see in the character sheet template a clear division between modules and, according to my criteria, a descending order from the "<i>most important</i>" to the "<i>not so relevant</i>". Can this be changed? Safely! Just take the ones you need/prefer.</p>

<p align="justify">Remember... This is a game... We are here to have fun!</p>
