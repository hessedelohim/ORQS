# **MECHANICS**

><p align="justify">All the adventures that we live through the TTRPG consist of three basic elements, exploration, social interaction and combat. Next we will explain the dynamics around these situations and how to "<em>solve</em>" them. The system was thinking to be modular, this mean, each part (or <em><strong>module</strong></em>) can be used separly, or combined with others, without the need of use everyone of them.</p>

**Why?**

<p align="justify">Easy, because not every game need the same things, or want to tell the same kind of adventure. Maybe there is a GM that comes up with a lot of story and characters, with a lot of social interaction, but no combat. Or can happened that the group may not care about factions, religions, neither the background of them self, and preferring to explore a lot of dungeons, kill a lot of monster, and collect a lot of weapons and items.</p>

**Also...**

<p align="justify">You will see on the character sheet model a clear division between modules and, accord to my criteria, a descending order from "<em>more important</em>" to "<em>not so relevant</em>" ones. Can this be changed? For sure! Just take the ones you need/prefer. And if you have enough knowledge (<em>ambition?</em>), can also modified the <a href="/aux/CharacterSheet-v.4.svg">sheet</a>.</p>

***<ins>Advantage / Disvantage</ins>***

> Depend of the action the player want to do, respect from the situation, three cases can be:
> 
> - Disvantage: the character reacts to an unexpected situation, or the situation is notably unfavorable due the enviroment or to its conditions (characteristics, status, weaknesses, etc).
> - Normal: nothing out of the ordinary in the setting or proposed actions.
> - Advantage: due to some external or internal condition of the character, it have the natural opportunity to obtain better results (is the one who ambushes, knows an answer in advance, attacks against a weakness, etc).
> 
> All these kind of onsiderations can be proposed by the players as well as by the storyteller, although their application is on the discretion of the last one. These can be specified in an ±X to the TVD (ex.: +1 on advantage).

***<ins>Movement</ins>***

> Unlike other systems, and to keep the idea of simplicity, at the beginning it was not thought to consider the movements of the characters in a measurable way, especially during battle. But this could easily be added with simple rules, for example:
> 
> - Use a grid (I prefer the hexagonal one)
> - Limit the number of moves per character per turn during combat (ex. 5)
> - For even more complexity, use a fixed value plus additional ones depending on agility, skills, magic, etc.
> - Some negative bonus can also be taken into account, typical of a terrain condition, spell, etc.
