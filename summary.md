# ORQS

ORQS is a rules-lite system to get started with TTRPG games. This is designed to be like a (*very*) basic framework on which everyone can build a personal core-book, for specific groups or games. Each "*rule*" is supposed to be considered in context, though they are also supposed to be flexible enough, to help the player not only understand, but also enjoy the experience of the dynamics of the TTRPGs.

The system was thought to be modular, that is, each part (*or module*) can be used separately, or combined with others, without the need to use all of them. You will see in the character sheet template a clear division between modules and, according to my criteria, a descending order from the "*most important*" to the "*not so relevant*". Can this be changed? Safely! Just take the ones you need/prefer.

> *NOTE: This summary contemplates that the players make use of all the modules.*

# CHARACTER CREATION

Each player will create a character defining the following information:

**NAME**: This is very important (*or maybe not...*), player and character are not supposed to necessarily share a name.
**RACE**: To indicate the origins of the character, it can also be useful to generate some background.
**PROFESSION**: Was the PC a hard worker? Or maybe a bounty hunter? Or maybe he really wasn't doing anything with his life.
**VIRTUE**: Something the PC stands out with particularly efficacious or quality. Generate the ***advantage*** status.
**WEAKNESS**: Very similar to a virtue, but just in a negative way (*generate the **disadvantage** status*).
**BACKGROUND**: It is the general knowledge of the PC, for example origin, culture, family, education, work experience.
**GOAL**: What the PC want most and what fight for. Their decisions and actions tend to this,

> The player can write just a few words or numbers on the PC sheet and make a better description in the side notes.

# ACTIONS

In general, all possible actions can be put into one of these three categories:

- **Social interaction**: Every time the PC deal with a NPC *(talking, bargaining, intimidating, etc)*.
- **Exploration**: Related to the search for something (*movements, examining, inferring, etc*).
- **Combat**: Both in attack and defense (*stabbing, evading a trap, casting a spell, etc*)

Every time there is a possibility of failure, the action will be checked by a dice roll (**2d6**) modified by its corresponding conditioners *(if applicable).* The Check Total Number (**CTV**) will lead to one of the following resolutions:

| **CTV** | **RESULT** | **DESCRIPTION** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 *(o less)* | GREAT FAIL | Does not achieve its purpose, and it get a very bad consequence |
| 3-6 | FAIL | Does not achieve its purpose |
| 7-9 | SUCCESS BUT... | Achieve its purpose, but get a side effect |
| 10-11 | SUCCESS | Achieve its purpose |
| 12 *(o more)* | SUCCESS + | Achieve its purpose and gets an extra benefit |

## **CONDITIONERS**

Depend of the action the player want to do, respect from the situation, the player will modify the Roll Total Value (**RTV)** with:

- The numerical value of the applicable **STAT**
- +2 according to the **virtue**
- -2 according to the **weakness**

Also, the environment, race, profession, background, faction, goal, etc. can generate one of these conditions:

- **Disadvantage**: The PC reacts to an unexpected situation, or the situation is notably unfavorable due the environment (*uncover, trapped, etc*) or to its conditions (*characteristics, status, weaknesses, etc*). **[Apply a -1 to the RTV].**
- **Normal**: Nothing out of the ordinary in the setting or proposed actions.
- **Advantage**: due to some external or internal condition of the character, it have the natural opportunity to obtain better results (is the one who ambushes, knows an answer in advance, attacks against a weakness, etc). **[Apply a positive value to the RTV, or use a extra dice, or secure a success]**.

All these kind of considerations can be proposed by both the players as well the storyteller, although their application is on the discretion of the last one. Can be specified in any other form, whatever you previously agreed.

## FAVOR POINTS

On certain occasions, one of the following cases may occur:

- The player wants to change his destiny (*ex. a bad roll to determine the stats*).
- The PC proposes an action that is considered extremely difficult or risky (***Heroic Action***).
- The party proposes an action that is considered extremely difficult or risky and everyone needs to be involved (***Epic Action***).

To solve it the players can choose to spend one of their **favor point** (FP), this will imply (*as the storyteller determined*), a re-roll of one dice, of both, or a guaranteed success. For Epic Action, everyone need to spend 1 FP.

> The PC will starts with 3 FP, and can earn one more accomplishing a objective that get it closer to the goal (*according to the storyteller's criteria*).

# COMBAT & HEALTH

Every time an attack (*from the PC or an enemy*) achieves a success, it will generate a Damage Point (**DP**) on the opponent's body part. Each part can receive up to 3 hits, and each phase will generates the following effects:

- **1 DP**: The PC is slightly wound, should rest in a safe place (*or in wilderness, make use of basic ability or equip*).
- **2 DP**: The PC is seriously hurt, only can be healed with basic ability or equipment (*can generate disadvantage*).
- **3 DP**: The PC is badly hurt, will need professional attention or magic to be healed (*generate a injury and disadvantage*). 
- **4 DP**: Depending on the part, the  PC will lose the limb, or become unconscious (*in thorax*), or die (*in head*).

>*To restore someone from the state of unconsciousness, someone must obtain a success (10 or more in the **CTV**) and it will be the only action during their turn.*

**INJURIES**

When a body part get the third hit, the storyteller must designate a **injury** and its consequence (*this can be a **conditioner** too*). After being reanimated, the PC also will get an additional **injury**, past 6 injures, die permanently.

## **BLESSINGS & CURSES**

At certain times it may be the case that the PC receives a blessing in some way. These are permanent conditioners that can apply to a STAT (*ex. +1 dexterity*), an action (*ex. all dagger attacks*), or a particular situation (*ex. when it's night*). Curses are equivalent, but with negative effects. The PC can have up to 3 of each.

# INVENTORY

The PC has its inventory divided into two parts of 6 slots each, in one it can carry weapons and pieces of armor. In the other various items. Each PC start without armor, but with 1 weapon and 2 items of free choice.

**WEAPON**: The type of weapon does not change the "*amount of damage*" generated, but it does affect the related stat depending on the action to be performed, the storyteller will decide which one to apply. For example, a bow can be used to shoot an arrow (DEX) or to hit someone (STR).

> Ammunition does not count towards slots and is considered infinite (unless otherwise agreed).

**ARMOR**: Each piece of armor adds one point of protection (PP) to the related body part. The total PP (*written inside the corresponding circle*) will be subtracted from the attack CTV.

**ITEMS**: Any other item that isn't armor or a weapon (at least one that can be directly considered one). It can be usable (*rope, torch, etc*), consumable (*food, potions, etc*) or unimportant (*a piece of stone*).

> Stackable or bulk items count as one slot.

# SKILLS

Each PC will start with an special ability of their choice. They can then learn more, up to a limit of 6. Skills may or may not be checked, and as a general rule, can be used only once per combat, or outside of these, approximately "once a day" (*at the storyteller's discretion*).

# SPECIAL CONSIDERATION

### <ins>***Magic***</ins>

In principle, magic does not require any ingredient, catalyst or energy, it is enough to know the spell to be able to use it. They count as skills in terms of their frequency and manner of use. Magical weapons (*staff, wand, etc*) are considered as such and are assigned to the corresponding slots. They are assigned a single "**magic attack**", the PC must lay down a minimal description of its operation (*effect, element, etc*).

### <ins>***Economy***</ins>

> *After the War of the Great Destruction, and with the great economic generated, The Last Emperor abolished the coinage. Instead, the Truekke system was chosen, an exchange of goods and services by mutual agreement between the parties.*

The **Merit** grade of the PCs will allow you to access better deals, and offers that were not available before. The storyteller timely grants a certain amount of merit, it is up to him how much and what new availability generates.

### <ins>*Factions*</ins>

In the world there are various factions, each one can provide certain benefits (*or drawbacks*). The PC can belong to up to 6 factions. Although this is intended more as a narrative resource than as a source of conditioners.

### ***<ins>Movement</ins>***

Unlike other systems, and to keep the idea of simplicity, at the beginning it was not thought to consider the movements of the characters in a measurable way, especially during battle. But this could easily be added with simple rules, for example:

- Use a grid (*I prefer the hexagonal one*).
    
- Limit the number of movement units per character per turn during combat (*for examp. 5*).
    
- For even more complexity, use a fixed value plus additional ones depending on agility, skills, magic, etc.
    
- Some negative bonus can also be taken into account, typical of a terrain condition, spell, etc.
    

### ***<ins>Extraordinary Exceptions</ins>***

On certain occasions, due to a divine force, or a magical power or some other reason (*crazy thought of the storyteller?*), phenomena out of the ordinary may occur. For example, it can be a weapon with increased damage against certain types of enemies, area action spells, armor with reinforced protection, or a injure being permanently restored. (*Even someone can recover a limb lost in battle!*).
